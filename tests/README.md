Tests and demonstrations of the splithalfr:
* **test_rapi_sum.R** Sum-score for data of the 23-item version of the Rutgers Alcohol Problem Index ([White & Labouvie, 1989](https://research.alcoholstudies.rutgers.edu/rapi))
* **test_vpt_diff_of_medians.R** Difference of mean RTs for correct responses, after removing RTs below 200 ms and above 520 ms, on Visual Probe Task data ([Mogg & Bradley, 1999](https://doi.org/10.1080/026999399379050))
* **test_aat_double_diff_of_medians.R** Double-difference-of-medians for correct responses on Approach Avoidance Task data ([Heuer, Rinck, & Becker, 2007](http://doi.org/10.1016/j.brat.2007.08.010))
* **test_iat_dscore_ri.R** Improved d-score algorithm for data of an Implicit Association Task that requires a correct response in order to continue to the next trial ([Greenwald, Nosek, & Banaji, 2003](http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.85.2.197))

All tests come with an Excel sheet in which the score for a single participant is calculated manually.
