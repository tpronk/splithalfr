Description: Estimates split-half reliabilities for scoring algorithms of cognitive tasks and questionnaires. The 'splithalfr' supports researcher-provided scoring algorithms, with six vignettes illustrating how on included datasets. The package provides four splitting methods (first-second, odd-even, permutated, Monte Carlo), the option to stratify splits by task design, a number of reliability coefficients, the option to sub-sample data, and bootstrapped confidence intervals.
