Description: Estimates split-half reliabilities for scoring algorithms of reaction time (RT) tasks and questionnaires. The 'splithalfr' supports researcher-provided scoring algorithms, with six illustration datasets and scoring algorithms being included. It provides five splitting methods (first-second, odd-even, permutated/bootstrapped/random sample of splithalves, Monte Carlo, and stratified), a number of reliability coefficients, and the option to sub-sample data.
